## Wiimm's CT-Archive Browser

### About

[Wiimm's CT Archive](https://ct.wiimm.de) is an archive of almost every custom
track available for Mario Kart Wii, however, its web interface can be 
cumbersome to browse, and its often easier to use the 
[Custom Track Wiiki](https://wiki.tockdom.com).

This project is intended to make browsing the archive easier, and eventually 
introduce extra features only possible on a local browser.

Although the archive is no longer being updated, its successor is currently still
early on, and therefore it serves as the best current option.

### Current Status

Currently the project is at a basic stage, featuring a python based script
allowing the retrieval of track-info and track downloading.

It is best combined with [WSZST](https://szs.wiimm.de) and [WIT](https://wit.wiimm.de).
