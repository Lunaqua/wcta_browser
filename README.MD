## Wiimm's CT-Archive Browser

### About

[https://ct.wiimm.de/](Wiimm's CT Archive) is an archive of almost every custom
track available for Mario Kart Wii, however, its web interface can be 
cumbersome to browse, and its often easier to use the 
[https://wiki.tockdom.com](Custom Track Wiiki).

This project is intended to make browsing the archive easier, and eventually 
introduce extra features only possible on a local browser.
